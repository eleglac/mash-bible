<br>: OPENING CREDITS
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>TRAPPER: Hey, is it possible to sue your feet for divorce?
<br>HAWKEYE: You might get custody of the arches.
<br>TRAPPER: Mine are killin' me. Sure wish they'd let us operate sittin' down.
<br>HAWKEYE: They might if we could talk the patients into standing up. Fix you a martini?
<br>FRANK: Haven't you anything better to do off duty than to lie around and swill gin?
<br>HAWKEYE: Swill gin?! Sir, I have sipped, lapped and taken gin intravenously, but I have never swilled! Actually, I'm pursuing my lifelong quest for the absolutely driest martini in the world. And I think I may have hit upon the perfect formula.
<br>TRAPPER: Five to one?
<br>HAWKEYE: Not quite. You pour six jiggers of gin and drink it while staring at a picture of Lorenzo Schwartz, the inventor of vermouth.
<br>FRANK: Twaddle.
<br>HAWKEYE: Watch your language, Frank, or I'll wash your mouth out with soap. By the way, did you know "soap" was a four-letter word?
<br>TRAPPER: Hey, Frank, are we disturbing you? Cos if we are, I can get shipped back to the States.
<br>FRANK: You're not disturbing me. I'm putting my time to good, constructive use.
<br>HAWKEYE: What are you doing? And that question itself shows how bored I am.
<br>FRANK: Writing my patients back home. I keep in touch with all of them.
<br>HAWKEYE: That's a pretty big job, isn't it?
<br>FRANK: Not really. I send them a form letter.
<br>HAWKEYE: "What's up front, Doc?"
<br>FRANK: A small joke.
<br>HAWKEYE: Almost stillborn. "Well, the fighting here goes on, but I must agree with MacArthur that the beginning of the end is in sight." Pretty stylish, Frank.
<br>FRANK: I wrote on the school paper.
<br>TRAPPER: I wrote on the walls.
<br>HAWKEYE: Should I read this or wait for the movie?
<br>FRANK: What do you mean?
<br>HAWKEYE: Well, you're quite a guy in here, Frank. Your exploits make Superman seem like a fairy.
<br>FRANK: Everything in there is true!
<br>HAWKEYE: It's such a commercial for yourself.
<br>FRANK: I had a good practice when I got called up. I won't let those people forget me while I'm here.
<br>TRAPPER: Maybe you could bring the plague back home, just to get things started again.
<br>HAWKEYE: Or introduce jungle rot to Indiana.
<br>FRANK: You're both jealous. I was in practice only three years, and I already had a $35,000 house and two cars.
<br>RADAR: Choppers!
<br>HAWKEYE: How many?
<br>RADAR: Too many.
<br>TRAPPER: We just got through two days of casualties.
<br>RADAR: Speak to the enemy, sir. Choppers!
<br><br>: INT O.R.
<br>HAWKEYE: Pull that back. Let's go, baby, or his kidney will never dance again.
<br>MARGARET: Can I help?
<br>HAWKEYE: Help her retract.
<br>TRAPPER: Hawkeye, this guy's full of shrapnel.
<br>HAWKEYE: OK. I'll be right there.
<br>FRANK: I can help in a minute.
<br>TRAPPER: Never mind. I'll wait.
<br>FRANK: You hand me the wrong instruments.
<br>HAWKEYE: You ask for the wrong instruments.
<br>FRANK: Will you shut up, Pierce?!
<br>HAWKEYE: How'd you like a spleen across the mouth?
<br>MARGARET: Gentlemen! You're doctors. Remember?
<br>HAWKEYE: I've seen better surgeons operating on trees.
<br>JONES: How many are waitin'?
<br>MARGARET: Two dozen, at least.
<br>JONES: I've got a bad pancreatic injury here.
<br>HAWKEYE: Resect it.
<br>JONES: Thanks, Hawkeye.
<br>FRANK: The book says drain it - always!
<br>HAWKEYE: If you were a proctologist, I'd tell you what to do with that book. Read your journals. Clean that up while I'm gone. Let's go! We got people double-parked!
<br><br>: INT C.O.'S OFFICE
<br>COL. BLAKE: I can't find anything.
<br>RADAR: You left it in your tent, sir.
<br>COL. BLAKE: My fishing catalogue?
<br>RADAR: Yes, sir.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Where do I sign?
<br>RADAR: Read it carefully. It's from Major Burns. He's in the hall.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Tell him I'm not in.
<br>RADAR: Yes, sir.
<br>: FRANK enters.
<br>RADAR: Sir?
<br>COL. BLAKE: Frank Burns has to be the biggest horse's patoot on this post.
<br>FRANK: You think so?
<br>COL. BLAKE: Frank... Dismissed.
<br>RADAR: You heard him, sir.
<br>COL. BLAKE: You seriously want to press these charges?
<br>FRANK: You bet I do.
<br>COL. BLAKE: "Insubordination. Failure to salute a superior officer."
<br>FRANK: I'm a major. Pierce has never saluted me once.
<br>COL. BLAKE: The nearest thing to a salute on this post is the camp mutt scratching behind his ears. "Lack of military courtesy. Captain Pierce constantly calls me by my first name."
<br>FRANK: <i>Not allowed, Henry. Page 85, The Army Officer's Guide.</i>
<br>COL. BLAKE: You honestly want him to call you "Major"?;frak
<br>COL. BLAKE: And I've got dimples on my butt! None of that means anything around here.
<br>FRANK: Shall we get on with the charges?
<br>COL. BLAKE: You insist on pressing them? Radar!
<br>RADAR: Yes, sir. I sent for Captain Pierce.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Get Captain Pierce.
<br>RADAR: This way, sir.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Show him in.
<br>HAWKEYE: Whatever it is, Henry, it better be good.
<br>FRANK: He's out of uniform, as usual.
<br>HAWKEYE: I tried sleeping in my uniform, but my medals keep stabbing me.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Burns says the operating room is becoming impossible.
<br>HAWKEYE: He's right. All that blood and everything. And those sick people? It's terrible.
<br>FRANK: You know what I mean. You're taking over. You answer every question, call every shot.
<br>HAWKEYE: You do it. I don't care.
<br>FRANK: They don't ask me the questions!
<br>HAWKEYE: Gee, I can't understand that. You've got a $35,000 car and two houses.
<br>FRANK: No, that's a $35,000 house and two cars. You worked in a hospital when they called you up.
<br>HAWKEYE: I realise it's ridiculous for a doctor to work in a hospital. It screws up your golf.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Burns does outrank you, Pierce.
<br>HAWKEYE: It took the UN to do it.
<br>FRANK: Listen, Pierce, you...
<br>COL. BLAKE: Knock it off! This can't continue.
<br>HAWKEYE: Why don't you sell me to the Red Sox?
<br>COL. BLAKE: I'd love to. But what I have to do is appoint a chief surgeon.
<br>FRANK: Now you're talking.
<br>COL. BLAKE: He'll be in charge of all surgical situations. In addition to his own work, he'll help with the really tough cases. The job will be a killer.
<br>FRANK: I can adjust.
<br>COL. BLAKE: I hope you can. I'm giving it to Pierce.
<br>HAWKEYE: Oh. Thanks.
<br>FRANK: What?! You can't! I won't stand for it!
<br>COL. BLAKE: Frank, the one thing that'll get you nowhere with me is impersonating my wife.
<br>FRANK: What about rank?
<br>HAWKEYE: Can I help it if I'm not as rank as you?
<br>FRANK: This is unheard of!
<br>COL. BLAKE: Face it. Pierce is the best cutter in the outfit. <i>He's certified in chest and general surgery.</i> Frank, in case you haven't read the papers, there's a war on. We're here to patch guys up. We can't be so GI we lose patients.
<br>FRANK: Are you implying he's a better doctor?
<br>COL. BLAKE: Yes, when the heat's on.
<br>FRANK: Well, if you want heat... I'll give you plenty of heat!
<br>COL. BLAKE: Frank..."Failure to salute a superior officer."
<br>HAWKEYE: Hey, you may just turn out to be one of the good guys yet, Henry.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Hawkeye... don't let me down.
<br>HAWKEYE: Would I do anything to disgrace this uniform?
<br><br>: INT MARGARET'S TENT
<br>FRANK: Margaret, I, uh...
<br>MARGARET: Frank! I... Oh, I was just, uh, fixing this cut I have on my head.
<br>FRANK: Margaret, something just awful's happened.
<br>MARGARET: Take a deep breath, Frank. Now tell me.
<br>FRANK: Margaret, something just awful's happened. Colonel Blake's appointed Pierce chief surgeon over me.
<br>MARGARET: He can't! It's against regulations! Doesn't he know that?
<br>FRANK: He did... and it is, and he does!
<br>MARGARET: Ohh, my poor baby. Frank, it's not unmanly to cry.
<br>FRANK: I would not give them the satisfaction.
<br>MARGARET: That's my strong fella.
<br>FRANK: Margaret...
<br><br>: INT MESS TENT
<br>P.A.: Attention, attention, all personnel. Barring the arrival of new casualties, at 2100 tonight there will be a special ceremony in the mess hall to crown the 4077th's new chief surgeon. That means tonight's movie is moved to tomorrow. It's the latest War Department film on the dangers of VD. Be sure to see it with someone you love.
<br>TRAPPER: Put on the record. Quiet, please, everybody! This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen and anything in between... ...it gives me great pleasure to present Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce, our new chief surgeon!
<br>: HAWKEYE enters to the strains of 'Pomp and Circumstance.'
<br>HAWKEYE: Thank you. Thank you. You may all kiss my ring.

<br>TRAPPER: Speech! Speech! Speech!
<br>HAWKEYE: Some men are born to greatness; others have it thrust upon them. And some of us got it both ways. Keep those crowds back behind the toilet paper.

<br>: MARGARET and FRANK are now making out.
<br>MARGARET: Frank...
<br>FRANK: Call me "Tiger".
<br>MARGARET: Frank... Your oak leaves are killing me.
<br>: MARGARET knocks her typewriter onto the floor, smashing it.
<br>FRANK: Now how will I be able to write the general?
<br>MARGARET: Come on.
<br><br>: INT MESS TENT
<br>HAWKEYE: But let me say this: Honestly, when you live in a cruddy situation like this long enough, you get to love a few people... and even hate a few. I guess, outside of our families, we'll never be closer to anybody than we are to each other.
<br>: All are solemn...
<br>TRAPPER: You finished?
<br>HAWKEYE: What did I get on the humble meter?
<br>: ... all groan.
<br>TRAPPER: One more thing. Then we gotta get back on duty.

<br>FRANK: We're so glad you're here, sir.
<br>MARGARET: So glad.
<br>GEN. BARKER: The situation better be as bad as you indicated.
<br>FRANK: It's worse, sir. There's a badly wounded patient who's been waiting to be operated on since 1.30, sir. He's just lying there, waiting.
<br>GEN. BARKER: It's two o'clock now.
<br>FRANK: 2.03.
<br>GEN. BARKER: All right, I'll get right into this. I may want to see you later, Major, for your own personal slant on all this.
<br>MARGARET: Yes, sir.
<br>GEN. BARKER: Just where, may I ask, is Chief Surgeon Pierce, with a patient waiting in surgery?

<br>: HAWKEYE, TRAPPER, UGLY JOHN, and KAPLAN play poker.
<br>HAWKEYE: I don't like this at all. No, sir. You took three?
<br>TRAPPER: Right.
<br>HAWKEYE: And you, Kaplan?
<br>KAPLAN: Two.
<br>HAWKEYE: And you didn't take any?
<br>UGLY JOHN: No.
<br>TRAPPER: How would you like a land mine up your moustache?
<br>UGLY JOHN: Ten bucks, Hawkeye. I'd like to win this pot while I'm young enough to enjoy it.
<br>HAWKEYE: Easy, fungus face. Call.
<br>TRAPPER: Out.
<br>KAPLAN: I fold.
<br>UGLY JOHN: Full house.
<br>HAWKEYE: Ahh, three of a kind, all bad.
<br>UGLY JOHN: I've seen bigger pots.
<br>HAWKEYE: Keep away from the mirror.
<br>KAPLAN: What're we playing?
<br>HAWKEYE: Threes and nines are wild. You can buy a new card with an open four.
<br>TRAPPER: Except February, which has 28.
<br>UGLY JOHN: Are we here to play or talk?
<br>KAPLAN: I think I'm here to lose.
<br>HAWKEYE: Ace bets a dollar, blind.
<br>: GEN. BARKER enters behind HAWKEYE; TRAPPER, UGLY JOHN, and KAPLAN snap to attention.
<br>HAWKEYE: That's a lot of respect for one ace.
<br>GEN. BARKER: As you were.
<br>HAWKEYE: Oh, hiya, General. What are you doing? Marching in your sleep? Ace bet a buck. Who's in?
<br>TRAPPER: I call.
<br>GEN. BARKER: I've been told you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible.
<br>HAWKEYE: You bet your bellybutton, Dad.
<br>GEN. BARKER: What?
<br>TRAPPER: Pair of twos says five.
<br>KAPLAN: Out.
<br>UGLY JOHN: In.
<br>GEN. BARKER: Pierce.
<br>HAWKEYE: A little late, General. I'll deal you in next hand.
<br>GEN. BARKER: That soldier requires surgery.
<br>HAWKEYE: Right. That's why I checked him into the hospital.
<br>GEN. BARKER: Are you gonna take care of him, or go on playing poker?
<br>HAWKEYE: General, the man came in with a chest wound. I'm watching him very carefully.
<br>GEN. BARKER: You call this watching?
<br>HAWKEYE: I get a bulletin every quarter hour from the nurse, who is very devoted and a great kisser.
<br>GEN. BARKER: When do you intend to operate?
<br>HAWKEYE: Hopefully, never. If I have to, around 3am. By then he will have his blood, and his pulse and pressure should be stabilised.
<br>GEN. BARKER: And until then you'll do nothing?
<br>HAWKEYE: Don't be ridiculous. Of course I'll do something. I'll meet his $5 and raise two more.
<br>GEN. BARKER: You're not talking to some idiot deskjockey, Captain! I'm a doctor myself.
<br>HAWKEYE: If you want to operate now, be my guest. I get the same pay whether I work or not.
<br>TRAPPER: Your two and two more.
<br>GEN. BARKER: Pierce... you're in very deep trouble.
<br>HAWKEYE: I don't think so. I can beat a pair of twos.
<br>UGLY JOHN: Oh, Dad...
<br>GEN. BARKER: This conduct is intolerable as a chief surgeon! I order you to begin that operation!
<br>HAWKEYE: General, either take the case yourself or join me at 3am. Let me concentrate on my poker. If I don't win this pot, I'll never be able to send my sister a new truss. The last raise is mine.
<br>GEN. BARKER: You haven't heard the last of this.
<br>HAWKEYE: I wasn't listening to the first of it.
<br>GEN. BARKER: We'll just wait until we hear what Colonel Blake has to say about it all.
<br>UGLY JOHN: Watch out for the...

<br>GEN. BARKER: You still got a patient?
<br>HAWKEYE: Well, at 1.30 when I checked him last, our guy had been given less than a pint of blood, whereas he'd lost two or three. His pulse was around 120, his pressure was down to around 90. Now, at three o'clock, he's been given three pints of blood, his pulse is 80, his pressure's 120, and he's received 5 million units of penicillin intravenously. His chest is still bleeding, but now we can operate safely and quickly. We don't have to do it frantically and carelessly. Let's get nice and sterile.

<br>TRAPPER: The general or the patient?
<br>HAWKEYE: See, Dad, we haven't found any small holes in the lung yet. Only large ones. I think he's got one in his lingula that we won't find unless we look for it. I've seen some bubbles I can't account for. Give me some suction here. And there it is.

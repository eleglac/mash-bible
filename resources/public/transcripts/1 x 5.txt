<br>: OPENING CREDITS
<br><br>: EXT COUNTRY ROAD
<br>: A jeep drives down the road into the 4077th compound.  SGT. BAKER and YOUNG HI exit.
<br><br>: EXT COMPOUND
<br>HAWKEYE: Look, it's daylight again.
<br>TRAPPER: 14 hours. Rough session. Very rough.
<br>HAWKEYE: Somebody is using the US Army for target practice.
<br>TRAPPER: Come on, let's get some breakfast and hit the sack.
<br>HAWKEYE: I'm with you, big fella. And this morning it's two olives in my breakfast.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Where can I find Colonel Blake's office?
<br>HAWKEYE: Yes, Sergeant. You go straight down there, turn left and, uh... Iook for a broken-down, dirty old man and follow him.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Yes, sir. He'll take me to Colonel Blake?
<br>HAWKEYE: That is Colonel Blake.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Thank you, sir. Young Hi.
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco, Sergeant Baker-san.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Find the noncom tent, organise a shower, unpack my fatigues and shine my boots. Draw rations from the mess tent and unpack the rest. And keep them cigarettes under lock and key. Understood?
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco.
<br>HAWKEYE: What'll she do with the rest of the day?
<br>TRAPPER: Practise her shorthand.
<br>SGT. BAKER: The gooks, they don't mind workin'.
<br>HAWKEYE: Sergeant. I don't care for that word.
<br>SGT. BAKER: "Gooks"?
<br>HAWKEYE: Yeah.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Nothing personal, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. OK, Young Hi, let's move.
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>HAWKEYE: What do you mean, his moose?
<br>RADAR: That's just the name for it, Hawkeye: moose. It's from musume, Japanese for "girl".
<br>HAWKEYE: Yeah? What's Japanese for "living together"?
<br>RADAR: Well, that might not be the case here. She could be just his servant.
<br>TRAPPER: Yeah? With or without fringe benefits?
<br>HO-JON: I talked to her. The sergeant bought her from her family for $500.
<br>HAWKEYE: Bought her? Is that what you said, or do we have a bad connection?
<br>HO-JON: Some of the locals sell their kids for the money. They have no other means.
<br>RADAR: That's right.
<br>TRAPPER: Do you believe that? That slob bought a human being!
<br>HAWKEYE: Why doesn't the army do something?
<br>RADAR: They will bust a guy if they find out, but they don't go looking for it.
<br>HAWKEYE: The dislike I felt for that sergeant has blossomed into instant hatred.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: I read someplace the UN was here to liberate these people. Must have been a misprint.
<br>HAWKEYE: I'm gonna do something. I'll talk to Henry.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: Henry? Our Henry?
<br>TRAPPER: Thought you said you were gonna do something about it.
<br><br>: INT C.O.'S TENT
<br>COL. BLAKE: Of course it's illegal and immoral. I can order Baker to release her and he can pick her up again after he leaves.
<br>HAWKEYE: Get in touch with his colonel. Ask him to order her release.
<br>COL. BLAKE: There's just one thing wrong with that.
<br>HAWKEYE: What?
<br>COL. BLAKE: Baker's colonel has a moose of his own.
<br>HAWKEYE: That's rotten. It stinks.
<br>COL. BLAKE: OK, OK.
<br>SCORCH: Excuse me.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Things dry quicker in my tent.
<br>HAWKEYE: I never thought you'd chicken out. If you haven't got any more guts than that, I'll quit this outfit. I'll quit the war.
<br>COL. BLAKE: Really? Well, who's gonna break the news to Truman and MacArthur.
<br><br>: EXT COMPOUND
<br>HAWKEYE: Hey, Young Hi, can we talk to you for a minute?
<br>YOUNG HI: You got washing?
<br>HAWKEYE: No, no, no, no. Uh... You understand that it's wrong for human beings to own each other?
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco, Captain-san.
<br>TRAPPER: Yeah, but... do you really understand?
<br>YOUNG HI: Yes. I make English perfect. Speak very goodly. Hello, Joe. What do you know? You got candy bar for mother? She sick.
<br>HAWKEYE: That's goodly enough for me.
<br>TRAPPER: Why do you stay with this Baker?
<br>HAWKEYE: Are you in love with that slob?
<br>YOUNG HI: What means "slob"?
<br>TRAPPER: It's a way of referring to another person.
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco. Don't love Baker slob-san. Don't make monkey business with him.
<br>HAWKEYE: Look, we can help you get away from Baker. You can go back to Seoul or anywhere you want.
<br>YOUNG HI: To run away, I dishonour my family. Sergeant pay money for me. I can leave only when he say.
<br>TRAPPER: Is it possible this kid likes her work?
<br>HAWKEYE: She doesn't understand. She's too young.
<br>YOUNG HI: I must work now. Must wash more socks, press shirts and shine boots.
<br>TRAPPER: Where were you when I wanted to get married?
<br>HAWKEYE: Go ahead, but tell Baker slob-san that Captain Pierce wants to see him on the double. You get it?
<br>YOUNG HI: I get it, Captain-san. Roger wilco.
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>: HAWKEYE is wearing his Class A uniform.
<br>HAWKEYE: Sergeant, we've never had anybody in this outfit who owned a moose. We don't believe in it. It's very un-American. It's un-Korean. It's un-everybody. Therefore I order you to release this person you've bought.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Sir...
<br>HAWKEYE: That is a direct order.
<br>TRAPPER: You heard the captain.
<br>HAWKEYE: I want her off this post and on the way back to her family by tomorrow morning. Dismissed. Dismissed.
<br>SGT. BAKER: What are you guys doin'? Buckin' to be chaplains?
<br>HAWKEYE: Stand at attention.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I've been in the army a long time, and no meat-cutter is gonna work me over. So save that GI crapola for the folks back home.
<br>HAWKEYE: Crapola? Will you... Make a note of that for his court martial.
<br>TRAPPER: You got a pencil?
<br>SGT. BAKER: I'm a transient. Your authority over me is limited, and you know it. So you can just stop tryin' to push me around. Now, is there anything else, sir?
<br>HAWKEYE: You know, you're a pretty decent guy at that, Baker. Right? And smart, too. Here, sit down. Baker, would you be interested in selling Young Hi?
<br>TRAPPER: Yeah, we've always wanted a moose of our own.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: A good transportation moose.
<br>HAWKEYE: A one-owner-type moose.
<br>SGT. BAKER: You just gave me a lecture...
<br>HAWKEYE: You gotta swing with the times. Now, look, you paid $500 for her, right? We'll give you six.
<br>SGT. BAKER: For Young Hi? You're outta your mind.
<br>TRAPPER: Have a martini.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Oh, thanks. I taught that kid laundry, cooking, sewing...
<br>HAWKEYE: Well, I realise she's not just another pretty face.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I could get double that for her in Seoul. But I ain't interested. Time's a-wastin'.
<br>HAWKEYE: Whoa. Stick around. We'll buy you more drinks.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I'll take a rain check. See ya, gentlemen.
<br>HAWKEYE: Do you believe that creep?
<br>TRAPPER: Yeah, he's your basic moose owner.
<br>HAWKEYE: Think it would look too suspicious if he got run over by a jeep in the shower?
<br>TRAPPER: I could say I took a wrong turn.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: I don't believe we can beat this joker.
<br>HAWKEYE: Then what the hell are we doing here? Why do we spend 18 hours a day putting people back together? Doesn't that have any meaning? What's the purpose of that? Practice? We gotta get that kid away from him.
<br>TRAPPER: How?
<br>HAWKEYE: What do we do best? Think.
<br>TRAPPER: How do we get her by drinkin' gin?
<br>HAWKEYE: I mean our real, if only, talent.
<br>TRAPPER: Operate on him.
<br>HAWKEYE: Right.
<br><br>: Later on, in the swamp, HAWKEYE, TRAPPER, JONES, UGLY JOHN and SGT. BAKER play poker.
<br>HAWKEYE: Ten bucks.
<br>TRAPPER: Too rich for me.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Your ten. I bump 50.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: That puts me away.
<br>UGLY JOHN: Yeah, me too.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Whaddaya say, Doc?
<br>HAWKEYE: Just a minute, handsome stranger.
<br>: HAWKEYE is shown to have an earpiece; RADAR is spotting SGT. BAKER'S cards from behind.
<br>RADAR: He's got a pair o' kings, an ace, and garbage. Got that?
<br>SGT. BAKER: Any time, Doc.
<br>HAWKEYE: Uh, your 50 and 50 more.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I call the raise.
<br>HAWKEYE: I'll take two.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Two good ones, off the top.
<br>RADAR: He kept the kings and the ace kicker. He bought a deuce... and another ace. He's got aces and kings.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I bet 100.
<br>HAWKEYE: And another 100, sweetheart.
<br>SGT. BAKER: You're bluffin'. I call. Aces up.
<br>HAWKEYE: No good. Three deuces.
<br>SGT. BAKER: You bet 150 bucks on three lousy deuces?
<br>HAWKEYE: I'm putting my sister through barber college. Any questions?
<br><br>: More time has passed.  Only HAWKEYE and SGT. BAKER are still playing.
<br>RADAR: He workin' on an open-end straight flush. All diamonds. He's got the two, three, four and five, and a jack of... spades.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I need a top card.
<br>HAWKEYE: Dealer takes one.
<br>RADAR: Shuffling, shuffling... The card he bought is... Hey, wait a minute. Something's blocking me.
<br>: A towel-clad nurse is walking past RADAR.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Whaddaya say, Doc? What's your bet?
<br>HAWKEYE: What's your rush? You got another war to go to?
<br>RADAR: Uh, I'm still blocked. Oh boy, am I blocked.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Bet or check, Doc.
<br>HAWKEYE: I'm thinking.
<br>RADAR: OK, the trouble's in the shower. I mean, the trouble's fixed. I'm... I'm unblocked. The card he bought is a six of clubs. No flush, but a baby straight.
<br>HAWKEYE: OK, partner, how much money you got there in front of ya?
<br>SGT. BAKER: About 750 bucks.
<br>HAWKEYE: Then that's the bet.
<br>SGT. BAKER: If I call, it cleans me.
<br>HAWKEYE: It's only money.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Baby straight.
<br>HAWKEYE: No. A teensy-weensy flush.
<br>SGT. BAKER: You got over 1,000 bucks of my dough.
<br>HAWKEYE: And let's not forget this little ol' IOU for 1200.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Oh, I'm good for it. I'll pay ya.
<br>HAWKEYE: The understanding, before we started, was a cash game.
<br>SGT. BAKER: You took my IOU.
<br>HAWKEYE: Only because you're a fine human being. Now pay up, fine human being.
<br>SGT. BAKER: I ain't got the money right now.
<br>HAWKEYE: You wanna get even, Baker? Get your IOU back and;hawk:1,000 of the money you lost? 
<br>SGT. BAKER: Who do I have to kill?
<br>HAWKEYE: Pick that up and put down your pink slip on Young Hi.
<br><br>: More time passes. HAWKEYE reclines and reads in the SWAMP.
<br>SGT. BAKER: She's all yours. I explained the whole deal.
<br>HAWKEYE: You understand, Young Hi?
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco, Hawkeye slob-san.
<br>HAWKEYE: Boy, once she learns somethin'...
<br>SGT. BAKER: Well, this is it. You're a good kid. If you ever need...
<br>HAWKEYE: OK, fine, Baker.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Yeah. Well, you take it easy...
<br>HAWKEYE: Shove off.
<br>SGT. BAKER: Yes, sir. Goodbye, kid.
<br>HAWKEYE: OK, now listen. You don't belong to Baker any more.
<br>YOUNG HI: Roger wilco. I belong to you.
<br>HAWKEYE: No, no, no. Now you can go back to your family. I paid the money. There's no dishonour.
<br>YOUNG HI: Go? I be good moose for Hawkeye slob-san. Make shave for you, shine shoes, make laundry, cooking on stove. You see. You be very satisfied.
<br>HAWKEYE: No, wait...
<br>YOUNG HI: I get my gear. Start work. You see. Everything be OK. You be happy like hell.
<br>HAWKEYE: Young... Young Hi!
<br>YOUNG HI: Yes, I come back. Don't worry, Hawkeye-san. I never leave you.
<br>HAWKEYE: "Dear Dad, we had a little poker game here today and it seems I won a person." "Dear Dad, I know you always wished I had a sister..." "Dear Dad..."
<br>: COMMERCIAL BREAK - RUNTIME 15:13
<br><br>: EXT OUTSIDE SWAMP
<br>: HAWKEYE is being shaved by YOUNG HI.
<br>TRAPPER: Hey, there's Captain Pierce, well-known surgeon and moose owner. The man who coined the phrase "No moose is good moose."
<br>HAWKEYE: Drop dead, singly and/or collectively.
<br>TRAPPER: Told you he's one of the great phrasemakers.
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: Holy cow!
<br>TRAPPER: We must be in the wrong tent. Hey, Hawkeye, come in here!
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: Yeah, get your butt in here.
<br>HAWKEYE: Yes?
<br>TRAPPER: Hawkeye, somebody sneaked in here and committed a neatness.
<br>HAWKEYE: Young Hi.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: Can you believe it? The clothes are hung up, no garbage on the floor, the place is clean.
<br>HAWKEYE: All right, OK, calm down. I'm as offended as you are by this repulsive tidiness. It's all arranged. There's a truck leaving this afternoon for Seoul and she'll be on it. Now, are you satisfied?
<br>TRAPPER: But as soon as she's gone, we dirty up the joint and get back to normal.
<br>HAWKEYE: They don't call you the aristocrat of the AMA for nothing.
<br><br>: EXT COMPOUND
<br>YOUNG HI: Please, no stay here with you?
<br>HAWKEYE: I told you. You got a right to a life of your own. And you're gonna have it.
<br>YOUNG HI: But I make you happy.
<br>HAWKEYE: No. So long, Young Hi. OK, driver, take off!
<br>YOUNG HI: I be good worker for you!
<br>HAWKEYE: Good luck, Young Hi.
<br>YOUNG HI: Please, I want to stay! I don't want to go!
<br>HAWKEYE: Good luck.
<br><br>: EXT MINEFIELD
<br>: HAWKEYE is cavorting with LT. JONES.
<br>LT. JONES: Oh, Hawkeye. Oh, your kisses are driving me crazy.
<br>HAWKEYE: And I'm only using one lip.
<br>LT. JONES: One question. Why are we sitting in the middle of a minefield?
<br>HAWKEYE: It's the only reservation I could get. Every jeep in town was sold out.
<br>LT. JONES: Oh, oh! You're biting my throat.
<br>HAWKEYE: Sorry. I got carried away and started a tracheotomy. Ow!
<br>LT. JONES: What is it?
<br>HAWKEYE: I bit your dog tag.
<br>LT. JONES: Oh, Hawkeye, why do I go out with you?
<br>HAWKEYE: Because I got class. I'm a high roller. Someday, baby, all this will be yours. The minefield, the cesspool - all of it.
<br>TRAPPER: Hey, Hawk!
<br>LT. JONES: Who is it?
<br>HAWKEYE: Trapper, our neighbourhood Peeping Tom. Turn off those lights.
<br>TRAPPER: We got trouble.
<br>HAWKEYE: What, wounded? I didn't hear any choppers. What is it?
<br>TRAPPER: The moose is back in town.
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>TRAPPER: She left when they stopped for gas. She hitched a ride back.
<br>HAWKEYE: Swell. What's the idea?
<br>YOUNG HI: I your moose, Hawkeye-san. I come back.
<br>HAWKEYE: But you're free.
<br>TRAPPER: Hawk, listen. We're sympathetic, you know. But this kid is part moose, part yo-yo.
<br>HAWKEYE: Hold it. Excuse us a second. Just stand there. Don't clean anything. Listen, tomorrow we send Ho-Jon into Seoul, we tell him to find her family, he brings one of them back here, and then they take her away.
<br>TRAPPER: What do we do until they get here?
<br>HAWKEYE: Teach her to be something besides a moose.
<br>TRAPPER: Give her a "person" lesson.
<br>HAWKEYE: Bingo. We can start de-moosifying her right now.
<br>TRAPPER: Is she gonna stay here?
<br>HAWKEYE: Well, Saint Frank is in Tokyo.
<br>YOUNG HI: Hawkeye-san make sleep in bed. I make sleep so.
<br>TRAPPER: No, no, no. You take that bunk over there.
<br>HAWKEYE: You can't make sleep like that.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: I'd like to make a little sleep over here.
<br>HAWKEYE: Sleep tight.
<br>TRAPPER: Don't let the bedbugs bite. I'll take the four o'clock feeding.
<br><br>: EXT COMPOUND
<br>HAWKEYE: OK, once more now. We've never met before, right?
<br>YOUNG HI: Right.
<br>HAWKEYE: OK. Hello there, I'm Doctor Pierce.
<br>YOUNG HI: How do you do? I am Young Hi.
<br>HAWKEYE: Very good.
<br>RADAR: Morning.
<br>YOUNG HI: Hello, Joe. Whatcha know?
<br>HAWKEYE: No, no. Forget that. Will you get lost?
<br>RADAR: Gee, a person says good morning and gets his ear bit off.
<br>HAWKEYE: Hello there, I'm Doctor Pierce.
<br>YOUNG HI: How do you do? I am Young Hi.
<br>HAWKEYE: Good. Keep going.
<br>YOUNG HI: I am very pleased to meet you. I am good?
<br>HAWKEYE: You are beautiful.
<br>YOUNG HI: Yes, I am.
<br>HAWKEYE: That you understand, huh?
<br><br>: INT MESS TENT
<br>HAWKEYE: Uh, Lieutenant Jones, Lieutenant Scorch.
<br>YOUNG HI: Hi. How do you do? I am pleased to meet you. My name is Young Hi. I am also beautiful.
<br>TRAPPER: Yes. Yes, you are.
<br><br>: EXT COMPOUND
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: And when you meet people, don't look down. Look them in the eye. And don't back off. We're all the same. Get it?
<br>YOUNG HI: Excuse it. Not same.
<br>SPEARCHUCKER: How do you figure?
<br>YOUNG HI: You need shave.
<br><br>: INT POST-OP
<br>TRAPPER: Hey, Hawkeye.
<br>HAWKEYE: Yeah?

<br>HAWKEYE: That's the man we wanna see.
<br><br>: INT SWAMP
<br>HAWKEYE: Hey, Ho-Jon! That's the head of the family?
<br>HO-JON: He's Young Hi's brother. His name is Benny.
<br>BENNY: Hiya, guys. How's the action?
<br>TRAPPER: An Eagle Scout he ain't.
<br>HAWKEYE: Go get Young Hi, OK? Did, uh... did Ho-Jon explain to you why we sent for you?
<br>BENNY: You bought Young Hi from Baker. Now you wanna dump her. What's the beef? She goofin' off?
<br>HAWKEYE: The Dead End Kids in Korea. I'll give this back when you're 50. You're here to take your sister home.
<br>TRAPPER: We don't want a moose.
<br>BENNY: No refund, guys. You understand that?
<br>HAWKEYE: We don't want any money. She's free to go.
<br>BENNY: Just like that? You guys are nuts.
<br>YOUNG HI: Hi, Benny!
<br>BENNY: Hey, Young Hi. How are you, baby?
<br>YOUNG HI: How do you do? I am pleased to see you. How is Mother and Father?
<br>BENNY: Pop's OK. Mom's still delivering for the black market.
<br>HAWKEYE: One Man's Family. -
<br>BENNY: They must be treating you OK. You look real big-time.

<br>YOUNG HI: But... you've come to take me?
<br>BENNY: You come back to Seoul and we'll get;benny:1,000, maybe 1500 bucks for you, easy. 

<br>HAWKEYE: Hold it. You can't let yourself be sold again.
<br>BENNY: You're brushing her off. What do you care?
<br>TRAPPER: I may get on my knees and punch this kid in the nose.
<br>HAWKEYE: You got a chance for a life of your own.
<br>TRAPPER: No more slobs.
<br>BENNY: What's all this jive? You know the score.
<br>YOUNG HI: I have duty to my family.
<br>HAWKEYE: And what about your duty to yourself?
<br>YOUNG HI: That is not how I was raised.
<br>BENNY: You tell 'em, baby. Let's get your gear.
<br>HAWKEYE: Young Hi.
<br>BENNY: Will you guys lay off?
<br>YOUNG HI: I remember everything you taught me. Everything. And I am grateful.
<br>TRAPPER: We got an E for effort, anyway.
<br>HAWKEYE: That's the way the moose bounces.
<br>TRAPPER: We came close, you know?
<br>HAWKEYE: Yeah, for a minute there...
<br>TRAPPER: Yeah.
<br>HAWKEYE: I could use a drink.
<br>TRAPPER: A triple, I think.
<br>YOUNG HI: I know how to make martini drink.
<br>TRAPPER: Young Hi. Are you staying?
<br>YOUNG HI: Not only staying - also not going. I tell Benny most important thing I learned from you. Who to tell "Shove off!"

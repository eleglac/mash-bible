Hawkeye goes to help at an aid station, and under heavy shelling he 
draws up a will, leaving various items to his friends at the 4077th. 
Hawkeye: "To Erin Hunnicutt. I leave a list of all the young men your 
daddy took care of while he was in Korea. Many of them have him to thank
 for being alive today. I want you to understand why he had to be away 
from you those first years of your life. I hope I have the chance to 
give you this list in person, but around here you never know."

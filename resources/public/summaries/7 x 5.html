Newscaster Clete Roberts, reprising an earlier interview appearance, 
returns to update Korean War conditions, when he conducts a series of 
television talks with the leading characters of the 4077th. Roberts: 
"Captain Pierce, when you leave here, what memories will you take with 
you." Pierce: "That's easy. The face of every kid who comes through 
here."

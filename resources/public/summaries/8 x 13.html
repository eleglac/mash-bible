A brawl at Rosie's Bar puts Rosie in the hospital, and the 4077th 
doctors are pressed into service as temporary saloon-keepers. Meanwhile,
 Father Mulcahy is apprehensive that his long-pending promotion to 
captain will again be denied. Potter: "The Pentagon. Weird looking 
building. Four walls and a spare. Monument to Murphy's Law."

Frank upsets Ginger, so Hawkeye puts his arm in a cast while he is 
asleep. Frank puts in for a transfer, and after a broadcast goes out of 
Frank telling Margaret he's leaving, she decides to leave as well. That 
night, Hawkeye and Trapper pretend they have found gold, letting Frank 
overhear them. Frank then withdraws his request when he thinks he's 
found gold himself, although the joke is on him when he finds, amongst 
other things, a gilded jeep!

When Hot Lips confines Nurse Baker to her quarters, little does she know
 that Baker's husband has arrived in the camp.  Hawkeye and B.J. put 
them together in Hot Lips' tent, telling everyone that a quarantined 
patient has been placed there.  When Hot Lips discovers what has 
happened, she breaks down and refuses to press charges. Margaret (to the
 nurses): "Did you ever once show me any friendship? Ever ask my help in
 a personal problem? Include me in one of your little bull sessions? Can
 you imagine how it feels to walk by this tent, and hear your laughter, 
and know that I'm not welcome? When did one of you ever even offer me a 
lousy cup of coffee?"

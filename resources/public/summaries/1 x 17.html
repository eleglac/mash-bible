Frank throws his back out whilst spending the evening with Margaret, and
 ends up in traction. He promptly applies for the Purple Heart, having 
been 'technically' wounded at a frontline unit. Tommy Gillis, an old 
friend of Hawkeye's, is writing a book about the war, and pays him a 
visit. Later, Tommy is brought into the camp, seriously wounded, and 
Hawkeye can't save him. A 15-year-old kid is in the hospital to have his
 appendix out. He joined up to be a hero back home, but Hawkeye has him 
sent home, giving him Frank's purple heart.

Hawkeye writes a heartfelt letter to President Harry Truman to protest 
at the continued fighting in Korea. Meanwhile, Colonel Ditka has 
promised a much-needed water-heater if the 4077th beautifies the camp. 
Hawkeye: "If you end this fiasco right now, I pledge to purchase all 
your daughter's inimitable records. Don't bother to deliver them. I'll 
pick them up on my way home."

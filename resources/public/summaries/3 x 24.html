One of the classic M*A*S*H episodes. Henry finally gets his discharge.  
While he is tying things up, Burns prepares for his new command.  Henry 
bids a tearful adieu, but not before Klinger turns up in an outrageous 
tropical outfit, and gets Henry to zip him up, and he gets a kiss 
Margaret.  He gives Radar a hug and his last order:  "You better be good
 now or I'm gonna come back and kick your butt!"  In the traumatic and 
shocking last scene, Radar announces that Henry has been killed when his
 plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. Hawkeye: "Henry, you're 
fired. Go home to your wife and kids."

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The writers and director kept the final scene 
from the cast, so that when they read the script, minutes before 
shooting the scene, they would show some real shock. It worked. From the
 following season on, Jamie Farr, as Klinger, was listed as a regular 
cast member, and so no longer appears as a recurring character. This was
 the last of his 30 appearances as a recurring character.

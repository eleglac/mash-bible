A Greek Colonel thanks the 4077th by giving them food and drink for an 
Easter celebration. Bu the feast is foiled when softhearted Radar saves 
the main course from the spit - a lamb, which Radar tricks Henry into 
giving a medical discharge and sends home to Ottumwa, Iowa. Thus, 
Hawkeye and Trapper invent the famed Spam Lamb! Meanwhile, a soldier who
 had shot himself to get out of the army confesses to Frank, thinking he
 is Father Mulcahy.

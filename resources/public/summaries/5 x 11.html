After 24 hours of surgery, Hawkeye and Potter venture off to a Korean 
hospital to lend a hand.  Hawkeye is appalled to learn that he must 
carry a gun.  After helping the Koreans, they are shelled on the way 
back.  They scramble from the jeep before it is shelled, and Potter 
urges Hawkeye to shoot in self-defense, against Hawkeye's will.

A riotous episode in which Hawkeye will do anything to get a new pair of
 boots: In order to get Zale to get him some, he must get an appointment
 for Zale with Futterman, the camp dentist, who will only do it if Henry
 will give him a pass to Tokyo, and Henry will only grant the pass if 
Houlihan will get off his back, which she will do only if the guys throw
 a party for Frank's birthday, with a cake, and Radar will only help get
 the cake if he gets a date with Nurse Murphy, who will only date 
someone with a hair dryer, and Klinger won't give up the hair dryer 
unless he gets a section 8 (and Frank won't sign). Inevitably, the deal 
falls through, much to the Hawkeye's chagrin.

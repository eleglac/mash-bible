Hawkeye has been in non-stop surgery for 3 straight days without sleep, 
and the wounded keep coming. He decides to find out who started the war,
 and sends a telegram to Harry S Trueman. After listening to some of 
Frank's rubbish about the North Koreans wanting better plumbing, he 
tries to send the officers' latrine to the North Koreans with an offer 
of peace. Trapper finally manages to sedate him. Trapper (about 
Hawkeye): "I guess he's just unstable. You see, he took this weird oath 
as a young man, never to just stand by and watch people die."

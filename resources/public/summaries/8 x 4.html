On leave in Tokyo, Radar is desperately needed back at the 
crisis-stricken 4077th, but his return is delayed by outside events.  
While casualties continue to pour in from the front, the 4077th's 
generator conks out, and the backup has been stolen, depriving the 
medical unit of all electrical power.  But Klinger, filling in for the 
vacationing Radar, lacks the expertise and experience to wheel and deal 
for a new machine.

The camp tunes into the Army/Navy football game, only to be shelled and 
have an unexploded bomb land in the middle of the compound. They ring 
around trying to identify the bomb, and the camp prepares for the worst.
 Hawkeye and Trapper are left the task of following instructions to 
disarm the bomb, which turns out to be full of propaganda leaflets from 
the CIA.

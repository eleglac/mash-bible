A severely wounded soldier, rushed to the poorly equipped 4077th by 
chopper, will die or be permanently paralyzed if he doesn't receive 
major surgery in 20 minutes.  Another soldier is dying and could provide
 an aorta graft. Nearly all of the action in this innovative episode is 
compressed into the program's 25-minute running time.

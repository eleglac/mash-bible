Hawkeye is outraged when a sensationalistic war correspondent, Clayton 
Kibbee, reports irresponsible G.I. stunts as tales of military valor. 
Kibbee: "As for the last two pints of blood, there's no big finale, no 
heroes. They helped an old soldier, who'd had visions of glory but 
finally got it through his thick head how tragic and inhumane war can 
be. Maybe he'll know better next time."

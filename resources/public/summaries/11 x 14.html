A wounded GI learns a painful lesson when he forms a recovery room 
friendship with the enemy soldier he's critically wounded. Soldier: "My 
boots. All he wanted was my lousy boots. His feet were freezing. I'd 
have done the same thing. He was just a guy like me, and I shot him. I 
killed him, for a pair of boots. How can I ever look at a pair of shoes 
again without thinking of him?"

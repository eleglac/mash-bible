Once again, Hawkeye writes home to his father, telling him of the latest
 gossip: the camp gets a new surgeon, who turns out to be a fake; 
Hawkeye bets he can walk into the mess tent naked for lunch, and no one 
will notice; Radar cheats on his final exam from the High School diploma
 company; Margaret rejects Franks advances and he gets drunk late into 
the night; the camp have a no talent night.

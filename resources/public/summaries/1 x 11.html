Hawkeye moves a wounded North Korean soldier into The Swamp, rather than
 let him be shipped out before he's stable. During the night he and 
Trapper play Dracula, and siphon off a pint of Frank's blood. The 
soldier then contracts hepatitis, so they have to test Frank without him
 knowing, and have to keep him away from Margaret and the patients.

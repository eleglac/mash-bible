B.J. almost becomes the surrogate father to a Korean family.  Finding 
them a substitute for his own absent family, B.J. spends so much time 
with them that his medical efficiency begins to suffer, and Hawkeye 
worries about his health. B.J.: "First they take me from my wife and 
kid, and just when I find something to help fill the gap, they take that
 away, too."

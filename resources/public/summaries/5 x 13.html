After Potter orders Radar to move a Korean spirit post believed to ward 
off evil spirits, things mysteriously begin to go wrong. When an old 
Korean man is brought into camp for medical attention, he refuses 
surgery unless the spirits in the camp are exorcised.  A priestess is 
brought in, who exhibits her dance and her bells and chants.  All is 
well, and Radar returns the spirit post to its original position.

After Hawkeye bemoans the young age of the wounded, he appears to 
develop problems.  Sleepwalking and bad dreams, according to Sidney 
Freedman, are taking Hawkeye back to a simple time, but the horrors of 
war continue to intrude.  After Sidney's assurances that he is as sane 
as can be, Hawkeye's life once again seems to settle down.

Hawkeye tries unsuccessfully to get to Seoul, to see Nurse Gilmore for 
the weekend.  Meanwhile, Winchester has taped a letter home, asking for 
his influential parents to help get him back to the States.  To get 
even, Hawkeye and B.J. switch Winchester's clothes, causing Winchester 
to alter his eating patterns.

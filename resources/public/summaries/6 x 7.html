With supplies low, the 4077th gets a truckload of ice cream churns and 
salt tablets. B.J. receives a mystery novel that everyone in camp reads 
in turn.  The last page is missing and the solution to the mystery is 
undiscovered until B.J. calls the author by long distance. Winchester: 
"I'll admit that what I did was inexcusable, maybe not totally. I've 
gone fourteen hours straight in the OR. And it was dark. But is that any
 excuse for misreading a label?  Not really.  If that man had died, his 
blood would have been on these hands. You could at least acknowledge, 
Pierce and Hunnicutt, that it takes a courageous man to admit when he's 
wrong."

After a delay of three weeks, five sacks of mail arrive, and everyone in
 camp reacts to good and bad news from home.  Hawkeye receives love 
letters addressed to another Benjamin Pierce, another man has approached
 B.J.'s wife, and Radar's mom has found a boyfriend.  Klinger: "I may 
not have a family in Toledo, but I got one here."

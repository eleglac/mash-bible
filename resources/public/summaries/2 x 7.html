Corporal Walker is being sent home, and he wants to marry his Korean 
girl so she and their baby can return with him. CID sends Lt Willis to 
investigate, but when he refuses Hawkeye and Trapper frame him. Hawkeye 
is upset that a nurse he was pursuing does not approve of the marriage 
between "a gook" and "one of us".

The Swamp is the tent where the doctors live. They have a Korean 
houseboy, Ho-Jon, who has been accepted into Hawkeye's alma mater.  The 
camp raises funds to send Ho-Jon to Maine by raffling a weekend in Tokyo
 with Nurse Dish, much to the disgust of Hot Lips and Frank. The winner?
  Father Mulcahy!

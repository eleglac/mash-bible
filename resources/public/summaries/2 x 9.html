Once more Hawkeye writes home to his father: the doctors operate on a 
soldier with a grenade shot into his body; Hawkeye and Trapper colour 
the skin of a racist patient, who demanded the right colour blood, while
 he is asleep; Henry gets a movie of his daughters birthday from home; 
the officers hold the monthly staff meeting.

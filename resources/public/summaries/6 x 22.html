With a temporary transfer of personnel between the 4077th and the 
8063rd, Captain Roy Dupree replaces Hawkeye, whilst Lorraine Anderson 
makes eyes at Charles.  Fearing this to be permanent, Charles and B.J. 
successfully conspire to have Dupree permanently removed from the 
4077th. Charles (to Hawkeye): "God, I'm so glad you're back."

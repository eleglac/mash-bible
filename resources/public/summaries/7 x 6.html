Charles becomes so irate, when he is turned down for a future medical 
position at home, that he refuses to talk to anyone in the unit, until 
Hawkeye and B.J. send him a false telegram from home. Meanwhile, a young
 soldier, Jerry Wilson, can't remember his own identity, so Sidney 
Freedman is called for help.

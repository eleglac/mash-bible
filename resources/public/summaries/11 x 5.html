Hawkeye volunteers to deliver the eulogy for a dead nurse that he 
briefly dated, and belatedly discovers her deep feelings for him. 
Hawkeye: "We thought she was kind of distant, unfriendly. In fact, she 
had a kind of awe for us, for having done our jobs so well for so long. 
She would have told us that, but she couldn't. She was too shy to 
express her deepest feelings, so she wrote them in her diary... It's too
 late for Milly to change, and that's sad. Maybe we can all take a page 
from her diary to remind us of what we all need to learn... To all the 
people here I have sweated and endured with, ... you're very important 
to me. I hope in the future I do a better job of letting you know it. I 
love every one of you."

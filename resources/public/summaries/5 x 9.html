After Frank discovers that Danny Fitzsimmons has shot himself to get out
 of combat, Father Mulcahy is called in.  Realizing his lack of 
understanding of the fighting, Mulcahy accompanies Radar to an aid 
station, where they encounter the real war at first hand.  Mulcahy 
performs an emergency tracheotomy, guided by Hawkeye over the radio.

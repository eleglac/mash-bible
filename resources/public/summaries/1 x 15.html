Clayton, Mulcahy
</p><p>
Hawkeye creates a fake doctor, Captain Jonathan S. Tuttle, to give 
supplies to the local orphans. Henry wants Tuttle to be officer of the 
day, so Hawkeye creates a fake personnel file, and all his back pay is 
given to the orphanage. When General Clayton wants to reward his 
generosity, Hawkeye is forced to invent a story about Tuttle jumping 
from a chopper without his parachute! Of course, Trapper's new friend, 
Captain Murdoch, obtained the fake dog tags and parachute...!

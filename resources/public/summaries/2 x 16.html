Henry returns from a week in Tokyo, to announce that he is in love with a
 20-year old girl called Nancy Sue Parker. She arrives for the weekend, 
and Henry shows her off. Nancy comes on to Hawkeye while Henry is in 
surgery. Henry is reminded of his wife back home when Radar places a 
call for him, and he realises it's his wife he loves.

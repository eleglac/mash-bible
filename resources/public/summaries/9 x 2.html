Members of the 4077th share their impressions of war in response to 
letters from fourth graders in Hawkeye's hometown. Margaret writes about
 how there are some patients she will never forget, whilst the Colonel 
tells of his days as 'Hoops' Potter. Hawkeye: "Dear Ronnie, it's a shame
 to let the love you have for your brother turn to hate for others. Hate
 makes war, and war is what killed Keith. I understand how you feel. 
Sometimes I hate myself for being here. But sometimes in the midst of 
all this insanity, the smallest thing can make my being here seems 
worthwhile. Maybe the best answer I have for you is that you look for 
good wherever you can find it."

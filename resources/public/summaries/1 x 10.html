A rash of thefts breaks out in the camp. Missing pieces include Frank's 
silver picture frame, Margaret's hair brush, and Trapper's watch. The 
camp is searched and everything is found in Hawkeye's locker. Everyone 
thinks he did it. Hawkeye manages to announce to the camp that the items
 will be dusted for prints to identify the real thief, and catches Ho 
Jon. He needed money to bring his family from the North, and to bribe 
border guards.

When Dr. Syn Paik, a North Korean surgeon, arrives with some wounded, he
 is passed off as a South Korean by Hawkeye and B.J., but to no avail.  
Hot Lips and Frank try to convince Potter that Paik is a spy.  Paik, 
Hawkeye, and B.J. agree that it would be in the interest of all for Syn 
to leave. Hawkeye: "Maybe they'd be interested in an exchange. We could 
keep Paik and give them Frank..."

Private Baker, who is always going AWOL, is desperate for plastic 
surgery on his nose. Hawkeye gets an old friend, and plastic surgeon, to
 visit the camp, promising him a nurse called "The Barracuda". They put 
together an elaborate scheme to perform the operation without Frank or 
Margaret finding out.

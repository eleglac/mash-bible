The army, at General Clayton's request, make a documentary about the 
4077th. The camera gets in the way and the resulting film is just a 
fairy tale. Hawkeye decides to expose the film and reshoot it his way, 
starring himself as Yankee Doodle Doctor. Hawkeye: "Three hours ago, 
this man was in a battle. Two hours ago we operated on him. He's got a 
fifty-fifty chance. We win some, we lose some. That's what it's all 
about... no promises, no guaranteed survival... no 'saints in surgical 
garb.' Our willingness, our experience, our technique are not enough. 
Guns have more power to take life than we have to preserve it. Not a 
very happy ending. But then no war is a movie."

In the midst of a deluge of patients and their individual medical 
histories, the 4077th is out of blood.  Everyone in camp is donating at 
48-hour intervals when a truckload of Turkish soldiers arrives to offer 
their blood and save the day. Moody: "When I was a kid, I used to fight 
all the time when people put me down. I believed what they said about 
me. Not any more. I've been up on the line. I had the guts to go out 
there and drag 'em back to the aid station. No one's gonna get me again 
with any verbal abuse because I got something guys like that will never 
have - self-respect."

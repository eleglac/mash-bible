As a cure for the increased tension at the 4077th, Potter obtains a copy of his favorite film, "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0038762">My Darling Clementine</a>",
 and makes a social event out of it.  As the film continues to break, 
tensions rise, until Mulcahy plays the piano, Radar does his 
impersonations, and everyone acts out scenes from the film.

Colonel Victor Bloodworth predicts that 280 wounded will arrive at the 
4077th.  Hawkeye is antagonized by Bloodworth and shoves him against a 
wall.  Bloodworth presses for a court martial until he becomes one of 
the wounded and watches Hawkeye saving a soldier's life.  Realizing 
Hawkeye's value as a doctor, Bloodworth drops all charges.

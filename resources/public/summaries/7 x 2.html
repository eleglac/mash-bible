Hawkeye becomes so disgusted with the stalled Panmunjon peace talks that
 he impulsively takes matters into his own hands, and goes to the 
meetings to lend a hand. Hawkeye: "Peace talks! I love it! They talk, 
and we get blown to pieces. The four or five eternities I've spent 
putting kids back together gives me the right to complain about this 
lousy, crummy, stinking war."

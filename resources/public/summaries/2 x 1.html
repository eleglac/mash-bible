General Clayton assigns a psychiatrist, Captain Hildebrand to examine 
the 4077th.  Henry tells them to be on their best behavior, or else they
 will be split up.  But the 4077th soon begins to act in their 
traditional, insane ways. Hildebrand: "In my short stay here, I've seen 
textbook examples of neuroses, psychoses, voyeurism, fetishism, and a 
few 'isms' I've never even heard of. The people here are mad, quite mad,
 all of them. They are impossible people in an impossible place doing 
impossible work. The only act I can think of that would be madder would 
be to break them up."

The supply lines to the camp are cut. Radar, the housing officer, starts
 doubling people up to save fuel and Klinger is thrown out of the 
nurse's tent. People start burning everything to stay warm while Frank 
wears his heated socks. The toilet paper supply is worst hit, and then 
wounded start arriving. Supplies are eventually restored.

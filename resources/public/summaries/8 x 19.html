Tired of their constant complaints about the quality of recreational 
activities at the 4077th, Colonel Potter appoints Hawkeye and B.J. as 
the new morale officers.  Winchester's morale has already reached a new 
peak:  He's ecstatic about his operation on a wounded soldier, Sheridan,
 which saved the boy's leg, leaving only "negligible" side effects - 
less use of his right hand.  However, the soldier was a concert pianist 
before the war, so Winchester obtains music written by Maurice Ravel for
 a pianist that had lost a hand in World War I.

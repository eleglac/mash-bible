The camp suffers from the severe cold, except for Hawkeye who has 
received some long john's from his father. They get passed around from 
person to person, as a gift, a gambling stake, a trade, a bribe, stolen,
 given up to Father Mulcahy, who gives them to Henry, who returns them 
to Hawkeye as thanks for taking out his appendix.

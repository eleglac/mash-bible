Dr. Borelli visits the 4077th to demonstrate his artery transplant 
technique.  Unfortunately, being so close to the front at the 4077th 
causes Borelli's drinking problem to interfere at the worst time - when a
 patient needs the transplant. Borelli: "I didn't drink at all in the 
First World War. I never drank when I was working in the second war. 
This place just got to me. I'd forgotten how rough the game can be. You 
have many good gifts, Hawkeye. It's a pity you can't number compassion 
among them. I wish you better luck in your third war."

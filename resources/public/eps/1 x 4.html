After Hawkeye and Frank argue, Frank decides to press charges, but Henry
 decides to make Hawkeye chief surgeon, because he is the better doctor.
 The camp throws him a party while Margaret and Frank complain to 
General Barker. But when Barker sees Hawkeye in action he is impressed. 
He declares the camp full of nuts, and Hawkeye a genius, and overrules 
the complaint.

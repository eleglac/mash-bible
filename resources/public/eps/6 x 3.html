At Hawkeye's suggestion, Radar goes to Seoul to find a woman at the Pink
 Pagoda.  He never gets there because of shelling along the way, when he
 is injured, and is flown to the 4077th.  Hawkeye, feeling tremendous 
guilt, is unable to perform an operation to save Radar, and is replaced 
by Potter. Hawkeye and Radar have a falling out as they lose respect for
 each other's actions. All is well in the end as Hawkeye pins a Purple 
Heart on Radar after he has recuperated.

<p>
While Colonel Potter goes to Tokyo on R&amp;R, his horse develops colic.
 Klinger becomes chronically depressed, and Hot Lips gets appendicitis. 
 The horse is flushed out with a hose, Hawkeye and B.J. perform an 
appendectomy on Hot Lips, and all are well when Potter returns, except 
Klinger.  Potter offers Klinger a discharge for severe depression, and 
Klinger gets very excited, which loses him the discharge.

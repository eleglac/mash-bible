While fixing a stove that explodes, Hawkeye's face is badly burned. His 
eyes are bandaged, and it is not known if he will ever see again. 
Meanwhile Frank bets on the outcome of a baseball game, which he has 
already heard on the radio.  After much tension in the camp the bandages
 come off, and happily, Hawkeye can see again. Hawkeye: "It was a lucky 
thing. First I got a chance to see without my eyes, and then I got them 
back."

A classic episode in which Colonel Flagg and another secret agent from 
another intelligence agency come to the 4077th to keep their eyes on one
 another and the camp.  Hawkeye and Trapper trick them both into 
thinking that Burns is a traitor - one thinks he's a fascist, the other 
thinks he's a communist. Vinny Pratt, a friend of Trapper's turns up.

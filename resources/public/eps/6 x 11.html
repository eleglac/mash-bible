Realizing how out of shape the 4077th is, Potter decides to hold a camp 
Olympic competition.  The winning team gets a three-day pass, so 
everyone is excited.  Donald Penobscot arrives to see Margaret, and is 
allowed to substitute for an ailing Klinger.  Hawkeye's team wins when 
Donald runs into a tree, and B.J. must then chauffeur Hawkeye around in a
 wheelchair for a week.

<p>
Colonel Potter turns crotchety when he catches the mumps, and his 
condition is worsened when Winchester gets the same disease and has to 
be quarantined with him.  A temporary replacement surgeon, Newsome, is 
quickly brought into the 4077th and seems to be a gem in terms of both 
personality and ability.

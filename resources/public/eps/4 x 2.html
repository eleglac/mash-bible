Things have changed at the 4077th: Henry went, and was killed on the way
 home, and Trapper has also been posted back to the States. So, Frank's 
dream is realized - he's in charge. But Hawkeye is unchanged. He skips 
camp, runs a blockade to find Trapper, and welcomes a new surgeon, B.J. 
Hunnicutt.

Prompted by pressure from Frank, Hot Lips sets a date for her marriage 
to Donald Penobscott.  When Donald arrives in camp, a bridal shower and 
bachelor party is given.  When he has passed out drunk, Hawkeye and B.J.
 place Donald in a body cast and convince him that he has broken his 
leg.  The ceremony is performed and Donald and Hot Lips leave for a 
week's honeymoon in Tokyo.  Frank: "No ring. No wedding date. I think 
it's 'thanks for the buggy ride.'"

A riotous episode, in which Hawkeye, driven near to insanity, starts a 
riot in the mess tent after several weeks of "a river of liver and an 
ocean of fish."  To spice up their diets, Hawkeye, Trapper, and Radar 
scheme to get spare ribs sent to the 4077th from Chicago.  The ribs 
arrive, just in time for the arrival of wounded.

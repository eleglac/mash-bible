The number of arriving wounded has increased because of a careless 
Colonel Lacy.  Hawkeye slips Lacy something to make him ill and removes 
his appendix, despite the strong protests of B.J. Hawkeye (to B.J.): "I 
hate myself right now. I hate me, I hate you, I hate my whole life here.
 But if I can get this maniac off the line by a simple appendectomy, 
then at least I can hate myself with a clear conscience."

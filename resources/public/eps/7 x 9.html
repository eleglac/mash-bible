Charles assumes heroic proportions after reviving a dying patient with 
heart massage, and he becomes more insufferable than ever when a 
photojournalist from Stars and Stripes, Tom Greenleigh, arrives to 
publicize his medical prowess. Hawkeye (to Charles): "You're pompous, 
arrogant, and a total bore. But you're all right!"

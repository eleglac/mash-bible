After Margaret leaves for her honeymoon, Frank becomes very distraught, 
so Potter sends him on R&amp;R. All throughout a deluge of casualties, 
the 4077th receives reports of a Frank Burns gone berserk. Potter calls 
Tokyo and requests a replacement surgeon. Major Charles Emerson 
Winchester III is assigned to the 4077th.  Frank Burns is apprehended, 
promoted, and transferred to a VA hospital in Indiana. Winchester is 
made a permanent part of the 4077th staff, much to his chagrin.

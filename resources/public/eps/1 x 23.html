General Clayton calls so say that a ceasefire is to be declared. The 
camp celebrates, Klinger gives away his dresses and locals start to take
 pieces of the camp. But Trapper does not believe it. Hawkeye claims he 
is married to avoid promises he made to several nurses. The party to 
celebrate the cease-fire, which never really took place, is interrupted 
by incoming wounds.

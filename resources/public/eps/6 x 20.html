Hot Lips, believing herself to be pregnant, asks Hawkeye to test her. 
The only rabbit available is Radar's pet, Fluffy. Hawkeye promises not 
to kill the rabbit while performing the test.  Meanwhile, Greenleigh, a 
patient, holds Charles and B.J. at gunpoint, demanding he be sent back 
to Ohio.  Greenleigh collapses from loss of blood, and Hot Lips isn't 
pregnant.

Hawkeye, Trapper and Radar try to keep a wounded Colonel at the camp for
 observation, since he has such a large casualty record. They make him 
think there is something more seriously wrong with him, and keep him 
away from Frank and Margaret. They get Henry drunk and have him send the
 Colonel back to the States.

A beautiful and ambitious young nurse, Harris, who plans to become a 
doctor when she leaves the Army, finds herself in a misunderstanding 
with Father Mulcahy.  Meanwhile, the camp's water supply is depleted, 
and the rest of the 4077th is more concerned about where their next 
shower will come from.

Klinger redecorates his quarters, but the resultant ridicule he receives
 drives him to new heights in his efforts to get out of the Army.  
Meanwhile, the doctors are perplexed by the reaction of an 
Asian-American war hero who tries to kill himself when he's told that he
 will be going home. Sidney Freedman is called in to assist.

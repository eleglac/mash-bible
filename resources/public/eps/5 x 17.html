Lieutenant Colonel Harold Beckett lies wounded in post-op waiting to get
 back to the front for thirty more days of combat duty to get his 
promotion.  Meanwhile, Cho Lin, the Ping Pong champ, is engaged to 
Soony.  He leaves to get her a ring, when the South Korean army 
conscripts him.  He arrives at the 4077th as a wounded soldier, and 
after being patched up he is married at the camp.

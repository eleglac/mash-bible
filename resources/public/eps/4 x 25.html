<strong>NOTE:</strong> Margaret does not appear in this episode. This 
was the first of two appearances by Clete Roberts, as himself. The 
second was in episodes 151 &amp; 152. This was Gelbart's last episode 
with the series. He had finally decided that there was little more he 
could add to the series.

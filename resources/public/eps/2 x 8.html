Majors Houlihan and Burns challenge Colonel Blake's fitness to command, 
and put Hawkeye and trapper under arrest so that they can't help him. 
Fortunately for Henry, they escape, and with the aid of Meg Cratty come 
to the rescue.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Roy Goldman appears here as an M.P. From episode 
53 he appears as a recurring character, not always called Roy, but 
ostensibly he is him, so he has been listed as such from there on.

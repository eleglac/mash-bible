Hawkeye and Trapper recover from an all night party. Henry gets a 
barbecue, and Hawkeye puts in a request for an incubator. The 
Quartermaster turns him down. They locate a Major with 3 incubators, but
 he won't let them have one. A Colonel tries to sell them one, and then 
they get into trouble with a General at a press conference. Finally, 
Radar trades the barbecue for an incubator.

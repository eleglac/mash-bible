Radar gets a Dear John recording from home. Hawkeye and Trapper try to 
set him up with a date, but fail. Radar is taken by a new nurse at the 
camp and she is into poetry and music, so they coach him. Margaret wants
 to stop the relationship, so Hawkeye and Trapper get between her and 
Frank until she relents. Radar's "Ahhhh, Bach!" and "That's highly 
significant," quotes win him the girl.

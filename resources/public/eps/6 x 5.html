The 4077th, caught up in tension and nerves, creates a bonfire to 
release their pressure.  Meanwhile, Sidney Freedman is depressed over a 
young soldier who blames him for his injuries, because Freedman had sent
 him back into combat. Tom (to Sidney): "I'll never forget what it felt 
like being put back in that foxhole, when you knew what I'd been 
through. I'll never forget having my leg shot off, and I'll never forget
 how much I hate you. Goodbye, Doctor!"  Sidney (to Klinger): "You're a 
tribute to man's endurance. A monument to hope in size 12 pumps. I hope 
you do get out someday. There would be a battalion of men in hoop skirts
 right behind you."

Hawkeye and Trapper operate on General Mitchell's son, and the General 
gives them 3 days in Tokyo and an officers club for the camp. They plot 
to allow the enlisted men access to the club, and when the General opens
 it the rules are bent to give his son access, which Hawkeye exploits to
 give access to all. Klinger pretends to be pregnant.

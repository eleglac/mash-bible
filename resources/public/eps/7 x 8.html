A strong windstorm affects the M*A*S*H personnel in varying ways: 
Hawkeye and most of the unit busy themselves securing items that could 
blow away; Radar prepares his animal hutch for the worst; a disgusted 
Charles switches his Tokyo-leave transportation from air to ground, and 
runs into a difficult medical situation en route to Seoul. Charles: "Be 
it ever so crumbling, there's no place like home."

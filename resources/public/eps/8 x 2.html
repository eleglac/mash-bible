A Congressional aide, Williamson, visits the 4077th on a supposedly 
routine fact-finding tour, but it's discovered that his motives are far 
deeper - too uncover Margaret as a communist sympathizer. His case is 
full of innuendo, so the gang set out to help Margaret. Hawkeye: 
"Freedom! Disgusting! Next thing you know they'll be threatening us with
 liberty and justice for us all."

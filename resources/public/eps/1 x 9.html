Henry receives a citation for the camp achieving the best efficiency 
rating, and then General Hammond reassigns him to Tokyo. Frank then 
changes the camp to be more military, and he confiscates Hawkeye's and 
Trapper's still. They use forged passes to go to Tokyo to convince Henry
 to come back and end up pretending Radar is sick.

A lone sniper has the 4077th pinned down - including Radar and Henry in 
the shower.  The poor boy thinks he's firing on McArthur's headquarters,
 and a chopper finally comes by and wounds him with gunfire from above, 
ending the siege. Hawkeye walks out to into the bush to tend to the 
wounded soldier.

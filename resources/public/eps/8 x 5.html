As company clerk Radar O'Reilly reluctantly prepares to depart the 
4077th, the unit is still without electricity due to a broken generator,
 and the operating room continues to fill up with war wounded as night 
falls.  The responsibility for procuring a new generator falls on 
Klinger, who lacks Radar's masterful knack of cutting through red tape 
in search of much-needed supplies.

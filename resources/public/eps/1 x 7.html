Hawkeye pretends to crack up to get some R&amp;R in Tokyo, but his plan 
backfires when Frank calls in a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist wants to 
take him away for observation, rather than prescribing R&amp;R, so he is
 set up to make him believe Margaret is interested in him, and is left 
in her tent.

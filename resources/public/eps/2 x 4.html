Hawkeye and Trapper want the army to admit responsibility for the 
accidental bombing of a local village. They fill out a report and Major 
Stoner arrives to investigate, and leaves with all the evidence. When 
the story is released it claims that the enemy bombed the village, and 
the army tries to gag the doctors. But, thinking there could be a medal 
in it for him, Frank has also put a report together, with copies of all 
the evidence, including shell fragments, so the army comes clean.

Radar gets accepted into the "Famous Las Vegas Writers School", and 
begins to write his impressions of the camp.  It happens to be Frank's 
birthday, so Hawkeye and B.J. stage a fight with each other to make 
Frank happy. Radar: "Dear Mum, I gave up the writing course on account I
 found out I can write better as myself than as Hemingway, O'Neill, or 
any of those other bums. Simplistically yours, Walter."

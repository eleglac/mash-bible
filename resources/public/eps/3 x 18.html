Hawkeye hits Major Burns and Houlihan is a witness. Despite Hawkeye and 
Trapper's claims that it wasn't intentional Frank makes allegations 
against Hawkeye. A female colonel is sent to investigate Burns' 
allegations.  When she cries "Rape!" when Burns visits her tent, 
Houlihan recants her story, and Burns, not Hawkeye, ends up under house 
arrest.

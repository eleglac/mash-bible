Potter is upset when General Waldo Kent informs him that people in the 
4077th are complaining about his leadership.  Potter returns to camp and
 discovers that the complaints are coming from a Corporal Benson, who 
had been sent by a disturbed Colonel Frank Webster, who had been wounded
 some months earlier.

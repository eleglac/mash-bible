Sidney Freedman, feeling depressed, visits the 4077th to observe how 
they fare under the pressures of war.  He begins a letter to Sigmund 
Freud as a form of self-therapy, and releases his tension in the form of
 a practical joke with B.J., aimed at Frank Burns. Freedman: "If there's
 a way to preserve your sanity in wartime, they've found it here. They 
slide their patched-up patients into the evac ambulance like loaves in a
 bread truck, and yet they never forget those packages are people."

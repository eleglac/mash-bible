Hawkeye and Frank argue over Frank's surgical ability. Hawkeye performs a
 difficult operation and the patient does not recover, as he should. 
Hawkeye begins to doubt his ability and moves out of The Swamp. He 
decides to open up his patients again, and discovers a nick in the colon
 that even Frank admits anyone could have missed.

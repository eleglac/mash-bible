Although reports that the war is almost over reach the camp with 
increasing frequency, the 4077th is still full with refugees and 
prisoners of war.  Fresh casualties pour in as both sides try to gain 
ground before the armistice.  A deeply troubled Hawkeye has been sent 
away to the psychiatric hospital where Dr. Sidney Freedman tries to help
 him find the cause of his breakdown, which is associated with a tragic 
incident on a trip back from R&amp;R at the beach.
</p><p>
Other members of the unit are coping with the final days of war, and 
making plans to get out:  Hot Lips's father is trying to find her a 
glamorous Army post; B.J. is determined to make it back for his 
daughter's birthday; Charles wants a plum appointment at a Boston 
hospital; Klinger worries about Soon-Lee's attempts to find her parents.
  A runaway Army tank that crashes into the compound and destroys the 
half-built latrine interrupts the normal business of the camp.
</p><p>
This has two results.  First, Charles wanders off to relieve himself and
 stumbles on a group of Chinese musicians.  They surrender and come back
 with him to the camp. Second, the enemy spots the tank and begins to 
shell the base.  Father Mulcahy bravely ventures out under fire to 
release the POWs, a shell explodes near him, and he suffers a mild 
concussion.  When B.J. examines him, he detects a hearing loss that 
Father Mulcahy begs him to keep from the rest of the company.
</p><p>
The barrage continues as the unit fails to move the tank out.  Hawkeye 
returns to the 4077th and is called straight into the O.R.  He is 
urgently needed because B.J. has received orders permitting him to go 
home, much to Hawkeye's chagrin.
</p><p>
Charles learns that he has been appointed to Boston hospital but 
quarrels violently with Hot Lips on discovering that she has pulled 
strings for him.  He consoles himself by teaching the Chinese musicians a
 little touch of Mozart.  Klinger, meanwhile, has brought back a 
reluctant Soon-Lee to the safety of the camp, although she is still 
determined to find her parents.  He is obviously in love.
</p><p>
The pressure on the company is temporarily relieved when Hawkeye, who 
has coped successfully with his return to surgery, drives the tank into 
the 4077th's trash dump, but only temporarily.  Fires started by 
incendiary bombs in the surrounding woods are visible from the camp and 
Colonel Potter orders evacuation proceedings: "Bug out!!"
</p><p>
The Colonel's desperate plea for a relief surgeon is answered 
unexpectedly by the return of B.J., who was already one-third of the way
 home when the Army recalled him to fulfill the Colonel's staff request.
  He misses his daughter's birthday, but the company hosts a birthday 
party for an orphan with B.J. as the guest of honor. Klinger proposes 
marriage and is accepted by Soon-Lee.  He is overjoyed.  Charles, 
however, is not so happy when he loses his "orchestra" to a relocation 
center.
</p><p>
The end of the war is only hours away, but the casualties keep coming in
 - among them Charles' flautist.  Finally, the surgical teams learn of 
the immediate ceasefire as they operate on a group of desperately 
wounded soldiers and civilians.  The war is over.
</p><p>
At the noisy, joyful camp party that night, members of the company talk 
about their lives after the war:  Colonel Potter looks forward to 
becoming a semi-retired country doctor; Hot Lips declares she has opted 
for the States and a big city hospital; Klinger announces his engagement
 and says that he is staying in Korea to help find Soon-Lee's parents - 
to everyone's amusement; Charles is still going to Boston, despite Hot 
Lips' "meddling"; B.J., of course, wants to go home, yet refuses to 
actually say "goodbye" to the others;  And Hawkeye?  Perhaps, after all,
 he will not be going to the big city surgical post that he always 
dreamed of...
</p><p>
After Klinger and Soon-Lee marry and leave the camp in traditional 
Korean style, the other members of the company depart one by one.  By 
now, the camp is a ghost town.  Father Mulcahy leaves to start a new 
life ministering to the deaf.  Hot Lips is kissed and hugged.  Even her 
disagreement with Charles is reconciled.  Charles himself exits with 
Rizzo in a garbage truck.  Colonel Potter takes Sophie for one last ride
 before the orphanage adopts her.  Finally, B.J. and Hawkeye go together
 on B.J.'s motorbike to meet Hawkeye's chopper. As Hawkeye looks down 
over the desolate camp, he sees a message B.J. has left on the pad: a 
GOODBYE marked out in stone.

"Nice war we had. Of course every war has its cute things. World War II 
had nice songs. The War of the Roses had nice flowers. We've got booms, 
they had blooms. Actually, every war has its 'ooms. You've got doom, 
gloom, everybody ends in a tomb, the planes go zoom, and they bomb your 
room."
